We have developed a machine learning (ML) model using the Random Forest algorithm to detect fake reviews
This was implemented using Python.It incorporated various feature types including Textual, User Behavior, Metadata, Random Forest-Specific
and other features.We achieved an accuracy of 83% in fake review detection.
